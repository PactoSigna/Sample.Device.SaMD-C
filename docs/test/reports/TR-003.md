# Test Report: Signal Quality Gating

**Executes:** [TP-003](../protocols/TP-003.md)
**Verifies:** [SRS-004](../../software/requirements/SRS-004.md)

## Test Environment

- Algorithm version: CardioSense v1.0.0-rc.1
- Test signals: Synthetic ECG with controlled noise injection (SNR: 0-40 dB)
- Test date: 2025-11-16

## Results

| Signal Quality (SNR) | Detection Suppressed | Expected | Status |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| 40 dB (excellent) | No | No | PASS |
| 20 dB (good) | No | No | PASS |
| 10 dB (marginal) | Yes | Yes | PASS |
| 5 dB (poor) | Yes | Yes | PASS |
| 0 dB (unusable) | Yes | Yes | PASS |

Suppression threshold: SNR < 15 dB (configurable).

## Observations

- The system correctly suppresses results for all signals below the quality threshold.
- Transition zone (12-18 dB) showed consistent behavior across 1,000 test iterations.

## Conclusion

All pass criteria from TP-003 are met. Signal quality gating is verified for release.
