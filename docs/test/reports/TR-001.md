# Test Report: AF Detection Sensitivity

**Executes:** [TP-001](../protocols/TP-001.md)
**Verifies:** [SRS-001](../../software-requirements/SRS-001.md), [SRS-002](../../software-requirements/SRS-002.md)

## Test Environment

- Algorithm version: CardioSense v1.0.0-rc.1
- Test dataset: MIT-BIH AF Database (1,024 episodes) + internal clinical dataset (512 episodes)
- Hardware: Ubuntu 22.04, NVIDIA A100 GPU
- Test date: 2025-11-15

## Results

| Metric | Target | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Sensitivity | >= 95% | 97.2% (95% CI: 96.1-98.0%) | PASS |
| Specificity | >= 90% | 94.8% (95% CI: 93.5-95.9%) | PASS |
| PPV | >= 85% | 91.3% | PASS |
| NPV | >= 97% | 98.1% | PASS |

## Observations

- Sensitivity was lowest (93.8%) in the 18-30 age group (n=47), likely due to lower AF prevalence in training data for this cohort. Overall sensitivity remains above threshold.
- No statistically significant difference between male and female subgroups (p=0.42).

## Conclusion

All pass criteria from TP-001 are met. The AF detection algorithm is verified for release.
