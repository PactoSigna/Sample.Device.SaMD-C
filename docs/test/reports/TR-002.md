# Test Report: Processing Performance Benchmark

**Executes:** [TP-002](../protocols/TP-002.md)
**Verifies:** [SRS-001](../../software/requirements/SRS-001.md)

## Test Environment

- Algorithm version: CardioSense v1.0.0-rc.1
- Load profile: 100 concurrent ECG streams, 250 Hz sampling rate
- Infrastructure: Firebase Cloud Functions, 2GB memory allocation
- Test date: 2025-11-18

## Results

| Metric | Target | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Median processing time | < 2s | 0.84s | PASS |
| 95th percentile | <= 2s | 1.62s | PASS |
| 99th percentile | — | 2.31s | INFO |
| Peak memory usage | < 2GB | 1.4GB | PASS |

## Observations

- Processing time increases linearly with concurrent streams up to 80, then sub-linearly due to GPU batch optimization.
- 99th percentile exceeds 2s threshold but this is not a pass criterion — documented for monitoring.

## Conclusion

All pass criteria from TP-002 are met. Processing performance is verified for release.
