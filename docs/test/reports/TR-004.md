# Test Report: Confidence Display Verification

**Executes:** [TP-004](../protocols/TP-004.md)
**Verifies:** [SRS-003](../../software-requirements/SRS-003.md)

## Test Environment

- Application version: CardioSense Mobile v1.0.0-rc.1 + Clinician Portal v1.0.0-rc.1
- Platforms tested: iOS 17.2, Android 14, Chrome 120, Safari 17
- Test date: 2025-11-20

## Results

| Test Case | Expected | Result | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| High confidence (>= 90%) | Green indicator, percentage shown | Correct on all platforms | PASS |
| Medium confidence (70-89%) | Yellow indicator, percentage shown | Correct on all platforms | PASS |
| Low confidence (< 70%) | Red indicator, percentage shown, review prompt | Correct on all platforms | PASS |
| Color contrast (WCAG AA) | >= 4.5:1 contrast ratio | All indicators pass | PASS |
| Tooltip on hover/tap | Explains confidence band meaning | Functional on all platforms | PASS |

## Observations

- Android renders confidence percentage with 1 decimal place vs. iOS integer display. Visually acceptable — no functional impact.
- Dark mode tested on all platforms — all indicators meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

## Conclusion

All pass criteria from TP-004 are met. Confidence score display is verified for release.
