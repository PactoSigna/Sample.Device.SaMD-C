# Test Protocol: Processing Performance Benchmark

**Verifies:** [SRS-001](../../software-requirements/SRS-001.md)

## Objective

Verify that ECG processing completes within 2 seconds under typical load conditions.

## Test Environment

- Hardware: Production-equivalent server (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- Load: Simulated 50 concurrent users
- Data: Standard 30-second ECG segments

## Procedure

1. Deploy detection engine to test environment
2. Generate simulated concurrent requests
3. Submit 1000 ECG segments over 10-minute period
4. Record processing time for each request
5. Calculate percentile distribution

## Pass Criteria

- 95th percentile processing time <= 2000ms
- 99th percentile processing time <= 3000ms
- No request timeouts

## Expected Results

| Metric      | Target  | Actual |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| P50 latency | <1000ms | [TBD]  |
| P95 latency | <2000ms | [TBD]  |
| P99 latency | <3000ms | [TBD]  |
| Error rate  | <0.1%   | [TBD]  |
