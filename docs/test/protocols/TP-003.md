# Test Protocol: Signal Quality Gating

**Verifies:** [SRS-004](../../software/requirements/SRS-004.md)

## Objective

Verify that the system suppresses detection results when signal quality falls below acceptable threshold.

## Test Data

- Good quality signals: SNR >= 15 dB
- Marginal quality signals: SNR 10-15 dB
- Poor quality signals: SNR < 10 dB

## Procedure

1. Submit good quality ECG segment
   - Expected: Detection result returned
2. Submit marginal quality ECG segment
   - Expected: Detection result returned with quality warning
3. Submit poor quality ECG segment
   - Expected: No detection result, quality error displayed

## Pass Criteria

- Good quality: Result always returned
- Poor quality: Result never returned
- Quality indicator displayed in all cases

## Expected Results

| Input SNR | Expected Result | Expected Quality Status |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 20 dB     | AFib result     | Good                    |
| 12 dB     | AFib result     | Acceptable              |
| 8 dB      | No result       | Poor                    |
| 5 dB      | No result       | Poor                    |
