# Test Case: Algorithm Sensitivity Validation

**Verifies:** [SRS-001](../software-requirements/SRS-001.md), [SRS-002](../software-requirements/SRS-002.md)
**Validates:** [UN-001](../user-needs/UN-001.md)

## Objective

Validate that the AFib detection algorithm achieves >=95% sensitivity on a representative clinical dataset.

## Test Dataset

- Source: MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database + internal clinical study
- Size: >=500 AFib episodes, >=500 normal rhythm segments
- Demographics: Diverse age (18-90), gender, ethnicity distribution

## Procedure

1. Load test dataset with ground truth labels
2. Process each ECG segment through detection engine
3. Compare detection results to ground truth
4. Calculate sensitivity: TP / (TP + FN)
5. Calculate specificity: TN / (TN + FP)

## Pass Criteria

- Sensitivity >= 95%
- Specificity >= 90%
- 95% confidence interval does not include threshold

## Expected Results

| Metric      | Target | Actual |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| Sensitivity | >=95%  | [TBD]  |
| Specificity | >=90%  | [TBD]  |
| PPV         | >=85%  | [TBD]  |
| NPV         | >=97%  | [TBD]  |
