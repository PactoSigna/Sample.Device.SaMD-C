# Harm: Stroke from Untreated Atrial Fibrillation

## Description

Patient suffers ischemic stroke due to undetected and untreated atrial fibrillation.

## Severity Assessment

**Severity Level: 4 (Critical)**

Potential outcomes:

- Death
- Permanent disability (paralysis, speech impairment, cognitive decline)
- Significant reduction in quality of life
- Extended hospitalization and rehabilitation

## Clinical Context

AFib causes blood to pool in the left atrial appendage, forming clots. These clots can travel to the brain, causing ischemic stroke. Risk is 5x higher in AFib patients without anticoagulation therapy.

## Applicable Regulatory Guidance

- ISO 14971:2019 Annex D - Severity classification
- FDA Guidance: Factors to Consider Regarding Benefit-Risk
