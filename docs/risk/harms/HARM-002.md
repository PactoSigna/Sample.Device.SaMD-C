# Harm: Delayed Treatment Initiation

## Description

Patient experiences delayed initiation of anticoagulation therapy due to missed or delayed AFib detection.

## Severity Assessment

**Severity Level: 3 (Serious)**

Potential outcomes:

- Elevated stroke risk during delay period
- Suboptimal therapeutic window
- Increased healthcare costs
- Patient anxiety upon eventual diagnosis

## Clinical Context

While not as severe as actual stroke, delayed treatment represents increased risk exposure. Each month of delay without anticoagulation increases cumulative stroke risk.

## Applicable Regulatory Guidance

- ISO 14971:2019 Annex D - Severity classification
