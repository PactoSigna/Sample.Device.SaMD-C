# SR-001: False Negative Detection Risk

## Hazard Identification

**Hazard**: AFib episode occurs but is not detected by the software

**Hazardous Situation**: Patient with undetected AFib does not receive appropriate medical intervention

**Harm**:
- Delayed anticoagulation therapy
- Increased risk of stroke (up to 5x baseline risk)
- Potential permanent disability or death from stroke

## Risk Analysis

### Severity Assessment

**Severity Level**: Critical (4)

Rationale: Undetected AFib can lead to stroke, which may result in:
- Death (worst case)
- Permanent disability (paralysis, speech impairment)
- Significant reduction in quality of life

### Probability Assessment

**Probability Level**: Occasional (3)

Rationale:
- AFib detection algorithms have known limitations
- Signal quality issues can affect detection
- Atypical AFib presentations may be missed
- Estimated occurrence: 1-5% of AFib episodes

### Risk Level

**Initial Risk Level**: HIGH (Severity 4 × Probability 3 = 12)

This risk level requires implementation of risk control measures.

## Risk Control Measures

### RC-001: High Sensitivity Requirement

**Control Type**: Inherently safe design

**Description**: Require algorithm sensitivity ≥ 95% (REQ-001)

**Verification**: Clinical validation study (TEST-001)

### RC-002: Algorithm Validation Protocol

**Control Type**: Protective measure

**Description**: Validate algorithm against expert-labeled dataset with ≥ 1,000 recordings (REQ-003)

**Verification**: Dataset documentation and validation report review

### RC-003: Signal Quality Gating

**Control Type**: Protective measure

**Description**: Only report negative results when signal quality is acceptable or better

**Verification**: Signal quality algorithm validation

### RC-004: User Instructions

**Control Type**: Information for safety

**Description**: User manual clearly states:
- Device is for screening, not diagnosis
- Negative result does not rule out AFib
- Consult healthcare provider if symptoms present

**Verification**: Labeling review

## Residual Risk Assessment

**Post-control Probability Level**: Remote (2)

Rationale: With 95% sensitivity and signal quality gating, false negative rate reduced to < 1%

**Residual Risk Level**: ACCEPTABLE (Severity 4 × Probability 2 = 8)

## Risk-Benefit Analysis

The residual risk is acceptable because:
1. The benefit of detecting ~95% of AFib episodes outweighs the risk of missing ~5%
2. Without the device, 100% of episodes would go undetected between clinical visits
3. Risk is further mitigated by clear labeling about device limitations
