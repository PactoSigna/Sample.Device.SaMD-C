# Hazardous Situation: Patient with Undetected AFib Does Not Seek Treatment

## Description

A patient who has atrial fibrillation receives a false negative detection result, leading them to believe they do not have AFib and therefore not seeking anticoagulation therapy.

## Probability Assessment

**Probability Level: 3 (Occasional)**

Factors:

- Algorithm false negative rate without controls: ~5%
- Patient reliance on device results
- Time between device check and next clinical visit

## Contributing Factors

- Poor signal quality during recording
- Atypical AFib presentation
- Patient asymptomatic (no symptoms prompting doctor visit)

## Resulting Harm

**Results in:** [HARM-001](../harms/HARM-001.md) - Stroke from Untreated AFib
