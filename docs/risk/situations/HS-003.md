# Hazardous Situation: Unauthorized Access to Patient Detection Records

## Description

An attacker gains unauthorized access to patient detection records through exploitation of API vulnerabilities or authentication weaknesses. Patient ECG data, AFib detection results, and personal health information are exposed to an unauthorized party.

## Probability Assessment

**Probability Level: 2 (Remote)**

Factors:

- API endpoints protected by OAuth 2.0 and role-based access control
- Regular penetration testing reduces window of exploitable vulnerabilities
- Cloud infrastructure hardened per IEC 81001-5-1

## Contributing Factors

- Weak or misconfigured authentication on API endpoints
- Injection vulnerabilities in query parameters allowing data exfiltration
- Token leakage through insecure storage or transmission
- Insufficient rate limiting enabling brute-force attacks
- Misconfigured cloud IAM roles granting overly broad access

## Resulting Harm

**Results in:** [HARM-003](../harms/HARM-003.md) - Patient Data Breach

## Related Hazard

**Caused by:** [HAZ-SEC-001](../../cybersecurity/risks/HAZ-SEC-001.md) - Attacker Exploits API to Access Patient Records

## Risk Controls

- [SRS-005](../../software/requirements/SRS-005.md) - API Authentication & Authorization
- [SRS-006](../../software/requirements/SRS-006.md) - Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit
- [TR-PEN-001](../../test/reports/TR-PEN-001.md) - Penetration Test Report verifying security controls
