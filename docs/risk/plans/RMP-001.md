# Risk Management Plan — CardioSense

## Scope

This plan establishes the risk management process for CardioSense, a Class C SaMD for continuous ECG monitoring and automated atrial fibrillation detection. It covers the complete product lifecycle from initial concept through post-market surveillance, in accordance with ISO 14971:2019.

## Applicable Standards

| Standard | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| ISO 14971:2019 | Risk management process for medical devices |
| IEC 62304:2015 | Software safety classification and risk controls |
| IEC 62366-1:2015 | Usability risk identification and evaluation |
| IEC 81001-5-1:2021 | Cybersecurity threat modeling and risk assessment |

## Risk Acceptability Matrix

Risks are evaluated on a 5x5 probability x severity matrix:

| | Negligible (1) | Minor (2) | Serious (3) | Critical (4) | Catastrophic (5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Frequent (5)** | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **Probable (4)** | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| **Occasional (3)** | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 |
| **Remote (2)** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
| **Rare (1)** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

### Acceptability Criteria

| Risk Rating | Classification | Action Required |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1-4 | Acceptable | Document rationale, no further action required |
| 5-9 | ALARP | Reduce risk as low as reasonably practicable; document justification |
| 10-25 | Unacceptable | Risk controls mandatory; must reduce to acceptable or ALARP with benefit analysis |

## Risk Management Team

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Risk Manager | Maintains risk file, coordinates risk reviews, ensures traceability |
| Software Engineer | Identifies software hazards (sFMEA), implements risk controls |
| Cybersecurity Engineer | Performs STRIDE threat modeling, assesses security risks |
| Usability Engineer | Identifies use-related hazards, conducts usability evaluations |
| Quality Manager | Reviews risk file completeness, approves residual risk acceptance |

## Risk Identification Methods

- **Software FMEA (sFMEA)**: Systematic analysis of software failure modes — [docs/software/risks/](../../software/risks/)
- **STRIDE Threat Modeling**: Security threat identification — [docs/cybersecurity/risks/](../../cybersecurity/risks/)
- **Use-related Risk Analysis**: Usability hazard identification — [docs/usability/risks/](../../usability/risks/)
- **Hazardous Situation Analysis**: Analysis of sequences of events — [docs/risk/situations/](../situations/)
- **Harm Assessment**: Clinical harm severity evaluation — [docs/risk/harms/](../harms/)

## Risk Control Verification

All risk controls are verified through test protocols in [docs/test/protocols/](../../test/protocols/). Each risk assessment document traces to the specific test that verifies control effectiveness.

## Residual Risk Evaluation

After applying all risk controls, the overall residual risk must be acceptable. If individual residual risks fall in the ALARP region, a risk-benefit analysis is performed to demonstrate clinical benefit outweighs residual risk.

## Risk Management Review

Risk management reviews are conducted:
- At each design review milestone
- When new hazards are identified (post-market feedback, CAPA)
- Before each release publish (automated validation gate)
