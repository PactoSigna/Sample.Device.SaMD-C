# Software Requirement: ECG Processing Performance

**Derives from:** [PRS-001](../product-requirements/PRS-001.md)

## Description

The software shall process incoming ECG data and complete AFib detection analysis within 2 seconds of data receipt.

## Rationale

Real-time detection requires timely processing. 2-second latency ensures clinicians see results promptly while allowing sufficient computation time for accurate analysis.

## Technical Specification

- Input: ECG signal data (250 Hz sampling rate, 12-bit resolution)
- Processing time: ≤2000ms from last sample to result
- Output: Detection result with confidence score

## Acceptance Criteria

- 95th percentile processing time ≤2 seconds
- Measured under typical system load
- Performance maintained with concurrent users
