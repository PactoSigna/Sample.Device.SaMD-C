# Software Requirement: R-R Interval Analysis Algorithm

**Derives from:** [PRS-001](../product-requirements/PRS-001.md)

## Description

The software shall detect atrial fibrillation by analyzing R-R interval variability patterns using a validated machine learning algorithm.

## Rationale

R-R interval irregularity is the primary indicator of AFib. ML-based analysis provides consistent, reproducible detection across diverse patient populations.

## Technical Specification

- Algorithm: Validated neural network model
- Input: R-R intervals extracted from ECG
- Features: Interval variability, Poincaré plot metrics
- Output: AFib probability (0.0 to 1.0)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Algorithm trained on ≥10,000 annotated ECG recordings
- Validation against hold-out dataset
- Sensitivity ≥95%, Specificity ≥90%
