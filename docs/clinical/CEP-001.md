# Clinical Evaluation Plan — CardioSense

## Scope

This plan defines the clinical evaluation strategy for CardioSense per MDR Annex XIV and MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4. The evaluation covers the safety and performance claims for automated atrial fibrillation detection from continuous ECG monitoring.

## Device Description

CardioSense is a Class IIa SaMD (EU) / Class II (US) that analyzes ECG signals to detect atrial fibrillation episodes. The software receives data from a wearable ECG sensor, processes the signal using a validated machine learning algorithm, and presents detection results with confidence scores to clinicians.

## Clinical Claims

| Claim | Evidence Source |
|-------|----------------|
| AFib detection sensitivity >= 95% | Algorithm validation study (TP-001) |
| AFib detection specificity >= 90% | Algorithm validation study (TP-001) |
| Alert latency < 30 seconds | Performance benchmark (TP-002) |
| No clinically significant false positives | Literature review + clinical study |

## Literature Search Strategy

### Databases
- PubMed / MEDLINE
- Cochrane Library
- IEEE Xplore (for algorithm validation studies)

### Search Terms
- "atrial fibrillation" AND "automated detection" AND "ECG"
- "machine learning" AND "arrhythmia" AND "sensitivity specificity"
- "software as medical device" AND "cardiac monitoring"

### Inclusion Criteria
- Published 2018-2025
- Peer-reviewed studies with >= 100 patients
- Studies evaluating automated AF detection from single-lead ECG

## Equivalence Assessment

CardioSense will be compared to predicate devices for equivalence per MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4:

| Characteristic | CardioSense | Predicate |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Intended use | Continuous AF detection | Continuous AF detection |
| Detection method | ML-based (CNN) | ML-based or rule-based |
| Input signal | Single-lead ECG | Single-lead ECG |
| User population | Adults with suspected arrhythmia | Adults with suspected arrhythmia |

## Clinical Data Appraisal

All identified literature will be appraised using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) levels of evidence. Only Level 1-3 evidence will be included in the benefit-risk analysis. Results are documented in [CER-001](CER-001.md).
