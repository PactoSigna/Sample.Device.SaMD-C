# Clinical Evaluation Report — CardioSense

## Executive Summary

This report presents the clinical evaluation of CardioSense per the strategy defined in [CEP-001](CEP-001.md). Based on the available clinical evidence, CardioSense demonstrates an acceptable benefit-risk profile for its intended use as an automated atrial fibrillation detection system.

## Literature Review Summary

A systematic search identified 47 relevant publications. After screening, 12 studies met inclusion criteria:

| Study Category | Count | Key Findings |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| ML-based AF detection validation | 5 | Sensitivity 94-99%, specificity 89-97% for CNN-based approaches |
| Single-lead ECG feasibility | 4 | Single-lead sufficient for AF detection in ambulatory settings |
| Clinical outcome studies | 3 | Early AF detection reduces stroke risk by 60-70% with anticoagulation |

## Performance Analysis

### Algorithm Validation (Internal Study)

Based on test protocol [TP-001](../test/protocols/TP-001.md) executed against the MIT-BIH AF Database:

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Sensitivity | >= 95% | 97.2% |
| Specificity | >= 90% | 94.8% |
| PPV | >= 85% | 91.3% |
| NPV | >= 97% | 98.1% |

### Equivalence to Predicate

CardioSense demonstrates equivalent or superior performance to published results for predicate devices using similar ML-based detection approaches.

## Benefit-Risk Analysis

### Benefits
- **Early detection**: Enables timely anticoagulation therapy, reducing stroke risk by up to 70%
- **Continuous monitoring**: Captures paroxysmal AF episodes missed by spot-check ECGs
- **Clinician support**: Confidence scoring helps prioritize clinical review

### Residual Risks
- **False negatives**: Residual risk of 2.8% missed detections (mitigated per [RISK-SW-001](../software/risks/RISK-SW-001.md))
- **False positives**: 5.2% false positive rate may cause unnecessary clinical follow-up

### Conclusion

The clinical benefits of early AF detection with demonstrated 97.2% sensitivity substantially outweigh the residual risks. The benefit-risk profile is acceptable for the intended use population.

## Post-Market Commitments

Ongoing clinical performance monitoring is defined in [PMS-001](../post-market/PMS-001.md), including PMCF study activities and real-world performance tracking.
