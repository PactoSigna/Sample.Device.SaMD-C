# User Need: Accurate Atrial Fibrillation Detection

## Description

As a patient with suspected cardiac arrhythmia, I need the software to accurately detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) episodes from my ECG data so that I can receive timely medical intervention and reduce my risk of stroke.

## Context

Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 33 million people worldwide. AFib significantly increases stroke risk (5x higher than normal). Early and accurate detection enables:

- Timely initiation of anticoagulation therapy
- Lifestyle modifications to reduce triggers
- Monitoring of treatment effectiveness

## Success Criteria

1. Detection works across diverse patient populations (age, gender, ethnicity)
2. Detection functions with varying ECG signal quality levels
3. Results presented in clear, understandable format
4. False negative rate minimized to reduce missed episodes

## Stakeholders

- **Primary**: Patients with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias
- **Secondary**: Cardiologists and primary care physicians
- **Tertiary**: Healthcare systems and insurers
