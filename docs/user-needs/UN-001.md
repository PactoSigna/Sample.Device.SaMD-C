# UN-001: Accurate Atrial Fibrillation Detection

## Description

As a patient with suspected cardiac arrhythmia, I need the software to accurately detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) episodes from my ECG data so that I can receive timely medical intervention and reduce my risk of stroke.

## User Context

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting approximately 33 million people worldwide. AFib significantly increases the risk of stroke (5x higher than normal) and heart failure. Early and accurate detection enables:

- Timely initiation of anticoagulation therapy
- Lifestyle modifications to reduce triggers
- Monitoring of treatment effectiveness
- Reduced anxiety through continuous monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system shall detect AFib episodes with clinical-grade accuracy
2. Detection shall work across diverse patient populations (age, gender, ethnicity)
3. Detection shall function with varying ECG signal quality levels
4. Results shall be presented in a clear, understandable format

## Stakeholders

- **Primary**: Patients with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias
- **Secondary**: Cardiologists and primary care physicians
- **Tertiary**: Healthcare systems and insurers

## Regulatory Context

This user need addresses the intended use of the device as defined in IEC 62304 and supports the Essential Principles for safety and performance of medical devices (IMDRF).
