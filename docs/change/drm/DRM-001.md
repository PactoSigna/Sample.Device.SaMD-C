# Design Review: ECG Algorithm v2.0

## Meeting Details

| Field         | Value                      |

## Scope

Review of the redesigned ECG analysis algorithm targeting improved AFib detection sensitivity per [SRS-001](../../software/requirements/SRS-001.md) and [SRS-002](../../software/requirements/SRS-002.md).

## Items Reviewed

### 1. Algorithm Architecture Changes

**Presenter:** Sarah Chen

Changes to the signal processing pipeline in [SDD-001](../../design/SDD-001.md):

- Replaced fixed-window FFT with sliding-window approach
- Added adaptive noise filtering for motion artifact rejection
- Implemented ensemble classifier combining CNN and LSTM outputs

**Review Finding:** Architecture changes are consistent with [HLD-001](../../architecture/HLD-001.md) component decomposition.

### 2. Risk Impact Assessment

Reviewed impact on existing risk controls per [RMP-001](../../risk/plans/RMP-001.md):

| Risk             | Impact | Mitigation Status |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| False negative   | Medium | Updated threshold validation in TP-001 |
| Processing delay | Low    | Latency budget unchanged               |
| Memory usage     | Low    | Within 512 MB allocation               |

**Review Finding:** No new hazardous situations introduced. Existing mitigations in [RISK-SW-001](../../software/risks/RISK-SW-001.md) remain adequate.

### 3. Verification Coverage

Verification plan review against [TP-001](../../test/protocols/TP-001.md) through [TP-004](../../test/protocols/TP-004.md):

- Unit test coverage target: 95% (current: 97%)
- Integration test protocols updated for new pipeline stages
- Performance benchmark added for sliding-window latency

**Review Finding:** Test coverage adequate for Class C device.

## Actions

| ID  | Action                                        | Owner           | Due        | Status   |
| --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A-1 | Update SDD-001 with sliding-window parameters | Sarah Chen      | 2025-12-20 | Complete |
| A-2 | Add memory profiling to TP-002                | James Rodriguez | 2025-12-22 | Complete |

## Decision

**Outcome:** Design approved for implementation with actions A-1 and A-2 completed.

All attendees confirmed the design meets the requirements in [SRS-001](../../software/requirements/SRS-001.md) and is consistent with the risk management activities in [RMP-001](../../risk/plans/RMP-001.md).
