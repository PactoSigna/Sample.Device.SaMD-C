# Technical Release Notes: CardioSense v2.1.0

> **Note:** This is an example document with `status: example`. It will appear in the document browser for reference but will not be included in release reviews. Copy this file and change `status` to `draft` to create your own release notes.

## Changes

### Architecture Changes

- Migrated AF detection inference engine from TensorFlow Lite v2.11 to v2.14 for improved ARM NEON vectorization.
- Introduced connection pooling for WebSocket connections (max 50 concurrent, 30s idle timeout).
- Added circuit breaker pattern for external notification service (3 failures → 60s open state).

### API Changes

- `POST /api/v2/alerts` — New endpoint for clinician alert acknowledgment.
- `GET /api/v2/recordings/:id/analysis` — Added `confidence_interval` field to response (non-breaking).
- Deprecated: `GET /api/v1/alerts` — Will be removed in v3.0.0.

### Database Migrations

- Added `alerts.acknowledged_at` column (nullable timestamp).
- Added composite index on `recordings(patient_id, created_at DESC)`.

### Security Updates

- Updated OpenSSL from 3.1.2 to 3.1.4 (CVE-2023-5678 fix).
- Enforced TLS 1.3 minimum for all API endpoints.

## Known Issues

| ID | Description | Severity | Workaround |
|----|-------------|----------|------------|
| ANO-012 | Battery optimization on Android 14 may delay background sync by up to 60 seconds | Low | Disable battery optimization for the CardioSense app |
| ANO-015 | PDF export may truncate long section titles in landscape mode | Low | Use portrait mode for exports with long section titles |

## Deployment Notes

- Requires database migration before API deployment (run `migrate-v2.1.0.sql`).
- Rolling deployment safe — v2.0.x and v2.1.x clients are wire-compatible.
- Monitor `alert_delivery_latency_p99` metric after deployment (target: <15s).
