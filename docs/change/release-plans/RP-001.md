### Excluded from Release

- Mobile app UI redesign (deferred to v2.1)
- FHIR integration (separate release track)

## Verification Strategy

Per [DEV-PLAN-001](../../software/plans/DEV-PLAN-001.md) and IEC 62304 clause 5.7:

### Unit Verification

- Target: 95% code coverage on changed modules
- Tool: Jest with coverage enforcement
- Responsible: Engineering

### Integration Verification

- Protocol: [TP-001](../../test/protocols/TP-001.md) — AFib detection accuracy
- Protocol: [TP-002](../../test/protocols/TP-002.md) — Performance benchmarks
- Protocol: [TP-003](../../test/protocols/TP-003.md) — Data integrity
- Dataset: MIT-BIH + PhysioNet Challenge 2017 (5,000 recordings)
- Responsible: Engineering + Quality

### Risk Verification

- Risk controls from [RISK-SW-001](../../software/risks/RISK-SW-001.md) re-verified
- Hazardous situations in [HS-001](../../risk/situations/HS-001.md) through [HS-003](../../risk/situations/HS-003.md) re-assessed
- No new residual risks above acceptable threshold

## Approval Requirements

| Role        | Department  | Scope                           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Author      | Engineering | Completeness of release package |
| Reviewer    | Engineering | Technical correctness           |
| Reviewer    | Quality     | Regulatory compliance           |
| Approver    | Quality     | Release authorization           |
