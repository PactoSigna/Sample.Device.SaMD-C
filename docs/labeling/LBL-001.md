# Instructions for Use — CardioSense

## Intended Use

See [IU-001 — Intended Use](../product/IU-001.md) for the canonical intended use definition.

The following is a summary for labeling purposes:

CardioSense is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) intended for continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. Detection results are presented to healthcare professionals for clinical review and decision-making.

**Intended users**: Patients (wearable monitoring), Healthcare professionals (clinical review)

**Intended patient population**: Adults (18+) with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias

## Indications for Use

CardioSense is indicated for the detection of atrial fibrillation from single-lead ECG recordings obtained through compatible wearable ECG sensors. It is intended as a clinical decision support tool and does not replace clinical judgment.

## Contraindications

- Not intended for use as the sole basis for clinical decisions
- Not intended for detection of arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation
- Not intended for use in patients under 18 years of age
- Not intended for use with implanted cardiac devices (pacemakers, ICDs)

## Warnings

- **Clinical review required**: All AF detections must be confirmed by a qualified healthcare professional before treatment decisions are made
- **Signal quality**: Detection accuracy depends on ECG signal quality; poor electrode contact may affect results
- **Not an emergency device**: CardioSense is not intended for acute cardiac emergency detection or response

## Setup Instructions

### Patient Setup
1. Pair compatible ECG wearable sensor via Bluetooth
2. Download CardioSense mobile application
