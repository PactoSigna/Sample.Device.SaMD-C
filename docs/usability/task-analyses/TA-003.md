# Task Analysis: Drill Into Raw ECG Data

## Description

The clinician navigates from the detection summary to the raw ECG waveform to independently verify the automated detection result and assess signal quality.

## Prerequisites

- Clinician has reviewed the detection summary (TA-001)
- Raw ECG data is available for the detection episode
- Clinician has ECG interpretation expertise

## Task Analysis (PCA)

| Step | Perception (What user sees) | Cognition (What user must understand) | Action (What user does) | Potential Use Error |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | "View ECG" button or link on detection summary | Understand this opens the raw waveform for the flagged episode | Click "View ECG" | May not realize this is available (button not prominent) |
| 2 | ECG waveform with time axis and amplitude | Visually identify P-waves, QRS complexes, and irregularities | Scan waveform for AFib indicators (irregular R-R intervals, absent P-waves) | May misidentify artifact as AFib or vice versa |
| 3 | Zoom and scroll controls for waveform navigation | Understand how to navigate to specific time segments | Zoom into areas of interest, scroll through recording | May miss relevant segments in a long recording |
| 4 | Signal quality overlay or indicator per segment | Understand which segments have reliable signal vs. noise/artifact | Assess whether flagged segments have adequate signal quality | May over-trust detection on noisy segments |
| 5 | Annotation tools or comparison view with algorithm markers | Understand where the algorithm flagged AFib episodes | Compare own assessment with algorithm detection markers | May anchor too heavily on algorithm markers (automation bias) |
| 6 | Clinical decision options (confirm, override, request re-analysis) | Decide whether to confirm, modify, or override the automated detection | Select appropriate action based on ECG review | May confirm without adequate review due to time pressure |

## Identified Hazards

### Automation Bias in ECG Review

- **Step:** 5
- **Use Error Type:** cognition
- **Description:** Clinician relies too heavily on the algorithm's detection markers rather than performing independent ECG interpretation, potentially confirming a false positive or missing a false negative in areas the algorithm did not flag.
- **Leads to:** [HS-002](../../risk/situations/HS-002.md) — Clinician Dismisses Valid AFib Detection
- **Severity:** 4 (from [HARM-001](../../risk/harms/HARM-001.md) — Stroke from Untreated AFib)

## Derived Requirements

None — existing requirements adequately cover ECG display and interaction needs.
