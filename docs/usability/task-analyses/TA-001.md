# Task Analysis: Review Patient Detection Results

## Description

The clinician reviews AFib detection results for a patient, interprets the confidence score, and decides whether to initiate treatment, order further testing, or dismiss the finding.

## Prerequisites

- Patient has worn the ECG device and data has been uploaded
- Detection algorithm has completed analysis
- Clinician has logged into the web application

## Task Analysis (PCA)

| Step | Perception (What user sees) | Cognition (What user must understand) | Action (What user does) | Potential Use Error |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | Patient list with detection status indicators (icons/badges) | Identify which patients have new detection results requiring review | Click on patient row to open record | May overlook patient with new results in a long list |
| 2 | Patient summary with detection result: "AFib Detected" or "Normal Sinus Rhythm" | Understand the detection outcome for this patient | Read detection result | May misread result if text is small or display is cluttered |
| 3 | Confidence score displayed as percentage with color coding (Green ≥90%, Yellow 70-89%, Red <70%) | **Interpret confidence level** — understand that lower confidence means the detection needs more scrutiny, not that it should be dismissed | Evaluate confidence in context of clinical picture | **Misinterpret low confidence as "unreliable/ignore" instead of "needs follow-up"** |
| 4 | Detection timestamp and ECG recording duration | Determine if data is recent and sufficient for reliable analysis | Check timestamp is within expected range | May not notice stale data from days ago |
| 5 | Option to view raw ECG waveform | Decide whether the detection warrants deeper review of the raw data | Click "View ECG" or proceed to next patient | May skip raw ECG review when confidence is borderline |
| 6 | Clinical action options (e.g., "Order follow-up", "Initiate treatment", "Dismiss") | Make treatment decision based on detection result + confidence + clinical context | Select appropriate clinical action | May select wrong action due to decision fatigue |

## Identified Hazards

### Misinterpretation of Confidence Score

- **Step:** 3
- **Use Error Type:** cognition
- **Description:** Clinician interprets a low confidence score (e.g., 72%) as meaning the detection is unreliable and should be ignored, rather than understanding it as a finding that needs additional clinical follow-up. This is exacerbated during high-caseload periods when review time per patient is reduced.
- **Leads to:** [HS-002](../../risk/situations/HS-002.md) — Clinician Dismisses Valid AFib Detection
- **Severity:** 4 (from [HARM-001](../../risk/harms/HARM-001.md) — Stroke from Untreated AFib)

## Derived Requirements

- **[PRS-003](../../product-requirements/PRS-003.md)** — Clear Detection Confidence Indicators: require color coding and numerical percentage that clinicians can interpret at a glance (discovered from Step 3 use error analysis)
