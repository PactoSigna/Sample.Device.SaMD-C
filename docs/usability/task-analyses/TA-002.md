# Task Analysis: Record ECG Data

## Description

The patient sets up the wearable ECG device, ensures a good signal connection, and allows the device to continuously record ECG data for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Patient has received the ECG device and mobile app
- Device is charged
- Mobile app is installed and paired with the device

## Task Analysis (PCA)

| Step | Perception (What user sees) | Cognition (What user must understand) | Action (What user does) | Potential Use Error |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | Device and electrode pads in packaging | Understand which side of electrode makes skin contact | Apply electrode pads to chest in indicated positions | Incorrect electrode placement reducing signal quality |
| 2 | Mobile app home screen with "Start Recording" button | Understand that recording must be explicitly started | Tap "Start Recording" | May forget to start recording, assuming it's automatic |
| 3 | Signal quality indicator (bar graph or icon) | Understand that green = good signal, red = poor contact | Adjust electrode placement if signal is poor | May ignore poor signal indicator |
| 4 | Recording status: "Recording in progress" with timer | Understand that device is actively recording | Continue daily activities | May accidentally stop recording by pressing button |
| 5 | Battery level indicator | Understand when device needs charging | Charge device when battery is low | May not notice low battery warning |
| 6 | "Recording complete — data uploading" notification | Understand that data needs to upload before clinician can review | Ensure phone has network connectivity | May dismiss upload notification before upload completes |

## Identified Hazards

### Incorrect Electrode Placement

- **Step:** 1
- **Use Error Type:** action
- **Description:** Patient places electrodes in wrong positions or with poor skin contact, resulting in low-quality ECG signal that may reduce detection accuracy.
- **Leads to:** [HS-001](../../risk/situations/HS-001.md) — Algorithm Receives Poor Quality Input
- **Severity:** 2 (from [HARM-002](../../risk/harms/HARM-002.md) — Delayed Treatment Initiation)

## Derived Requirements

None — existing requirements adequately cover this workflow.
