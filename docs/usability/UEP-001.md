# Usability Engineering Plan — SaMD-C AFib Detector

## Intended Use

The SaMD-C AFib Detector is intended for continuous ECG monitoring and automated detection of atrial fibrillation episodes. Patients wear the ECG device and the software records and analyzes data. Clinicians review detection results, confidence scores, and raw ECG data to make treatment decisions.

## User Groups

### Patient (Wearable ECG User)

- **Profile**: Adults with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias
- **Training**: Minimal — setup instructions provided with device
- **Use Environment**: Home, daily life activities
- **Use Frequency**: Daily (continuous wear)
- **Use Specification**: [US-001](use-specifications/US-001.md)

### Clinician (Data Reviewer)

- **Profile**: Cardiologists, primary care physicians, clinical staff
- **Training**: Medical degree + device-specific orientation
- **Use Environment**: Clinic or hospital, potentially under time pressure
- **Use Frequency**: Daily during patient reviews
- **Use Specification**: [US-002](use-specifications/US-002.md)

## Task Analyses

| ID     | Task                             | User Group | Critical | Ref                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| TA-001 | Review patient detection results | Clinician  | Yes      | [TA-001](task-analyses/TA-001.md)        |
| TA-002 | Record ECG data                  | Patient    | No       | [TA-002](task-analyses/TA-002.md)        |
| TA-003 | Drill into raw ECG data          | Clinician  | Yes      | [TA-003](task-analyses/TA-003.md)        |

## Evaluation Strategy

- **Formative evaluations** during design iterations to refine the confidence score display and patient setup flow
- **Summative evaluation** before release to validate all critical tasks can be completed without use errors leading to hazardous situations

## Acceptance Criteria

All critical tasks (max_harm_severity >= 3) must be evaluated with representative users. No use errors leading to hazardous situations with severity >= 3 may occur during summative evaluation without mitigation.
