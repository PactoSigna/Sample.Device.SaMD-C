# Usability Engineering Plan — SaMD-C AFib Detector

## Intended Use

See [IU-001 — Intended Use](../product/IU-001.md) for the canonical intended use definition.

## User Groups

### Patient (Wearable ECG User)

- **Profile**: Adults with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias
- **Training**: Minimal — setup instructions provided with device
- **Use Environment**: Home, daily life activities
- **Use Frequency**: Daily (continuous wear)
- **Use Specification**: [US-001](use-specifications/US-001.md)

### Clinician (Data Reviewer)

- **Profile**: Cardiologists, primary care physicians, clinical staff
- **Training**: Medical degree + device-specific orientation
- **Use Environment**: Clinic or hospital, potentially under time pressure
- **Use Frequency**: Daily during patient reviews
- **Use Specification**: [US-002](use-specifications/US-002.md)

## Task Analyses

| ID     | Task                             | User Group | Critical | Ref                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| TA-001 | Review patient detection results | Clinician  | Yes      | [TA-001](task-analyses/TA-001.md)        |
| TA-002 | Record ECG data                  | Patient    | No       | [TA-002](task-analyses/TA-002.md)        |
| TA-003 | Drill into raw ECG data          | Clinician  | Yes      | [TA-003](task-analyses/TA-003.md)        |

## Evaluation Strategy

- **Formative evaluations** during design iterations to refine the confidence score display and patient setup flow
- **Summative evaluation** before release to validate all critical tasks can be completed without use errors leading to hazardous situations

## Acceptance Criteria

All critical tasks (max_harm_severity >= 3) must be evaluated with representative users. No use errors leading to hazardous situations with severity >= 3 may occur during summative evaluation without mitigation.
