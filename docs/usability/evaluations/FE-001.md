# Formative Evaluation: Confidence Score Display

## Objective

Evaluate whether clinicians can correctly interpret the detection confidence score and make appropriate clinical decisions, focusing on the hazard identified in TA-001 Step 3 (misinterpretation of confidence score).

## Method

Moderated usability test with think-aloud protocol. Participants reviewed simulated patient records with varying confidence scores (95%, 72%, 45%) and described their interpretation and intended clinical action.

## Tasks Evaluated

- [TA-001](../task-analyses/TA-001.md) — Review Patient Detection Results (Steps 2-6)

## Participants

- 5 clinicians (3 cardiologists, 2 primary care physicians)
- Experience: 3-15 years clinical practice
- All familiar with clinical decision support systems

## Findings

### Finding 1: Confidence Score Interpretation

- **4 of 5** participants correctly interpreted confidence scores when color coding was present
- **1 participant** initially interpreted 72% (yellow) as "unreliable" but self-corrected after reading the tooltip
- **Recommendation**: Add contextual help text explaining that yellow means "review recommended" not "unreliable"

### Finding 2: Confidence Score Visibility

- **3 of 5** participants noted the confidence percentage was too small on the summary view
- **Recommendation**: Increase font size of confidence score and ensure it meets WCAG AA contrast requirements

### Finding 3: Action Selection

- All participants selected clinically appropriate actions for high and low confidence detections
- **2 participants** hesitated on the 72% case, but ultimately made appropriate decisions

## Conclusion

The confidence score display design is effective but requires minor refinements:

1. Add contextual help text for yellow-band confidence scores
2. Increase confidence score font size on summary view

These findings were addressed in [PRS-003](../../product/requirements/PRS-003.md) acceptance criteria refinements.
