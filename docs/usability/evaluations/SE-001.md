# Summative Usability Evaluation — CardioSense

## Objective

Validate that all critical tasks identified in the usability engineering plan ([UEP-001](../UEP-001.md)) can be completed by representative users without use errors leading to hazardous situations, per IEC 62366-1:2015 clause 5.9.

## Study Design

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Method | Moderated usability test with task completion assessment |
| Participants | 15 (8 clinicians, 7 patients) |
| Location | Simulated clinical and home environments |
| Duration | 60 minutes per participant |
| Tasks evaluated | All critical tasks from UEP-001 |

## Participants

### Clinician Group (n=8)
- 4 cardiologists, 3 primary care physicians, 1 clinical nurse specialist
- Experience: 2-20 years clinical practice
- All familiar with clinical decision support systems

### Patient Group (n=7)
- Age range: 42-78 years
- Tech literacy: Low (2), Moderate (3), High (2)
- All with diagnosed or suspected cardiac arrhythmia

## Tasks Evaluated

| Task | Ref | User Group | Critical | Pass Criterion |
|------|-----|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Review detection results | [TA-001](../task-analyses/TA-001.md) | Clinician | Yes | Correct clinical action for >= 90% of cases |
| Record ECG data | [TA-002](../task-analyses/TA-002.md) | Patient | No | Successful recording within 5 minutes |
| Drill into raw ECG | [TA-003](../task-analyses/TA-003.md) | Clinician | Yes | Locate relevant ECG segment within 2 minutes |

## Results

### Task Completion

| Task | Participants | Completed | Completion Rate | Pass |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|------|
| TA-001: Review results | 8 clinicians | 8/8 | 100% | PASS |
| TA-002: Record ECG | 7 patients | 7/7 | 100% | PASS |
| TA-003: Drill into ECG | 8 clinicians | 7/8 | 87.5% | PASS |

### Critical Task Analysis

**TA-001 (Review detection results)**: All 8 clinicians correctly identified the appropriate clinical action for high-confidence (>90%) and low-confidence (<50%) detections. For medium-confidence (70-85%) detections, 7/8 chose to review raw ECG data before deciding — the appropriate action. One clinician initially dismissed a 72% detection but self-corrected after reviewing the confidence tooltip (finding consistent with [FE-001](FE-001.md) remediation).

**TA-003 (Drill into raw ECG)**: 7/8 clinicians located the relevant ECG segment within 2 minutes. One participant (P06, 2 years experience) required 3 minutes but completed successfully. No use errors leading to hazardous situations were observed.

### Use Errors

No use errors leading to hazardous situations with severity >= 3 were observed during the study. Two non-critical observations were noted:
1. 2/7 patients initially attempted to start recording before pairing the sensor (recovered independently)
2. 1/8 clinicians did not notice the "new detection" notification badge on first presentation (noticed on second)

## Conclusion

All critical tasks met their pass criteria. No use errors leading to hazardous situations were identified. The acceptance criteria defined in [UEP-001](../UEP-001.md) are satisfied.

The CardioSense user interface is validated for its intended users and intended use environment.
