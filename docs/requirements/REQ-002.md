# REQ-002: AFib Detection Specificity

## Description

The software shall detect atrial fibrillation episodes with a specificity of at least 90% when compared to cardiologist adjudication.

## Rationale

Adequate specificity is essential to minimize false positives, which can cause:

- Unnecessary patient anxiety
- Inappropriate medical interventions
- Healthcare resource waste
- Reduced trust in the device

The 90% threshold balances:
- Clinical utility (avoiding alarm fatigue)
- Practical constraints of automated detection
- Regulatory expectations for screening devices

A higher sensitivity threshold (95%) vs specificity (90%) reflects the clinical priority of not missing true AFib episodes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Specificity ≥ 90% on validation dataset (n ≥ 500 non-AFib episodes)
- Validation dataset includes common AFib mimics (PACs, artifact, sinus arrhythmia)
- Specificity maintained across patient demographics
- Statistical confidence interval of 95% CI

## Verification Method

Clinical validation study with independent cardiologist adjudication (see TEST-002)
