# REQ-003: Algorithm Validation Control

## Description

The AFib detection algorithm shall be validated against a curated dataset of at least 1,000 ECG recordings with ground truth labels established by consensus of three board-certified cardiologists.

## Rationale

This requirement establishes the validation methodology that ensures the detection algorithm performs as specified. It serves as a risk control measure for SR-001 (False Negative Detection Risk) by:

- Ensuring algorithm performance is verified against expert clinical judgment
- Requiring sufficient sample size for statistical validity
- Mandating consensus-based ground truth to reduce labeling errors
- Establishing a repeatable validation framework for algorithm updates

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Validation dataset contains ≥ 1,000 ECG recordings
2. Dataset includes:
   - ≥ 500 confirmed AFib episodes
   - ≥ 500 non-AFib recordings (including normal sinus rhythm and other arrhythmias)
3. Ground truth established by majority vote of 3 board-certified cardiologists
4. Inter-rater reliability (Fleiss' kappa) ≥ 0.8
5. Dataset demographics representative of intended use population

## Verification Method

- Dataset documentation review
- Cardiologist qualification verification
- Statistical analysis of inter-rater reliability
- Demographic distribution analysis
