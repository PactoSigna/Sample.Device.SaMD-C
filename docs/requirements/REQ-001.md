# REQ-001: AFib Detection Sensitivity

## Description

The software shall detect atrial fibrillation episodes with a sensitivity of at least 95% when compared to cardiologist adjudication.

## Rationale

High sensitivity is critical for a screening/detection device to minimize false negatives (missed AFib episodes). A missed AFib episode could result in:

- Delayed treatment initiation
- Increased stroke risk
- Patient harm from preventable complications

The 95% threshold aligns with:
- FDA guidance for cardiac rhythm detection devices
- Published clinical validation standards for AFib detection algorithms
- Competitive device performance benchmarks

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sensitivity ≥ 95% on validation dataset (n ≥ 500 AFib episodes)
- Validation dataset includes diverse patient demographics
- Sensitivity maintained across ECG signal quality levels (good, acceptable, poor)
- Statistical confidence interval of 95% CI

## Verification Method

Clinical validation study with independent cardiologist adjudication (see TEST-001)

## Risk Control

This requirement serves as a risk control for SR-001 (False Negative Detection Risk)
