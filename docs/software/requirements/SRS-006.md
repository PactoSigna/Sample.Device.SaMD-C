# Software Requirement: Detection Result Persistence

**Derives from:** [PRS-002](../../product/requirements/PRS-002.md)

## Requirements

1. The software shall persist every detection result to the database within 1 second of analysis completion.
2. Each persisted result shall include: detection outcome (AFib detected: yes/no), confidence score, analysis timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC), ECG segment reference, signal quality value at time of analysis, and algorithm version.
3. Persisted results shall be retained for a minimum of 7 years in accordance with the data retention policy.
4. Persisted results shall be queryable by patient identifier, date range, and detection outcome.

## Verification Criteria

- Integration test confirms result written to the database within 1 second of algorithm output (see TP-006 §2.1)
- Data model review confirms all 6 required fields are stored on every result record
- Retention policy test: records cannot be deleted before the 7-year retention window has elapsed
- Query test: results retrievable by patient ID, date range, and outcome filter within 3 seconds for 90-day windows
