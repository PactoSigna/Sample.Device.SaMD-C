# Software Requirement: ECG Processing Performance

**Derives from:** [PRS-001](../../product/requirements/PRS-001.md)

## Requirements

1. The software shall complete AFib detection analysis within 2 seconds of receiving the last ECG sample.
2. The 2-second latency budget applies end-to-end: from data receipt through algorithm execution, database write, and API response.
3. Performance shall be maintained under typical system load as defined in the Software Development Plan.

## Verification Criteria

- 95th-percentile processing time ≤ 2000 ms, measured across ≥ 1000 representative ECG segments (see TP-001 §3.1)
- Load test confirms latency budget maintained under concurrent user load
- Latency measurements instrument all pipeline stages individually to isolate regressions
