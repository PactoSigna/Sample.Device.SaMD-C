# Software Requirement: Confidence Score Display

**Derives from:** [PRS-002](../../product/requirements/PRS-002.md), [PRS-003](../../product/requirements/PRS-003.md)

## User Story

As a clinician reviewing ECG detection results on the monitoring dashboard,
I want to see a colour-coded confidence score alongside each detection result,
so that I can immediately assess the reliability of the result without needing to interpret raw numbers.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario: High-confidence result is displayed in green**

```gherkin
Given a detection result with a confidence score of 90% or above
When the clinician views the monitoring dashboard
Then the confidence score is displayed as a green percentage (e.g. "95%")
And the progress bar fill colour is #4CAF50
```

**Scenario: Moderate-confidence result is displayed in yellow**

```gherkin
Given a detection result with a confidence score between 70% and 89%
When the clinician views the monitoring dashboard
Then the confidence score is displayed as a yellow percentage
And the progress bar fill colour is #FFC107
```

**Scenario: Low-confidence result is displayed in red**

```gherkin
Given a detection result with a confidence score below 70%
When the clinician views the monitoring dashboard
Then the confidence score is displayed as a red percentage
And the progress bar fill colour is #F44336
```

**Scenario: Confidence score appears promptly after analysis**

```gherkin
Given a detection result has just been produced
When the dashboard refreshes
Then the confidence score is visible within 1 second of the detection result appearing
```

**Scenario: Tooltip explains confidence methodology**

```gherkin
Given a clinician is viewing a confidence score
When the clinician hovers over or taps the score
Then a tooltip is shown that explains how the confidence score is calculated
```
