# Software Requirement: R-R Interval Analysis Algorithm

**Derives from:** [PRS-001](../../product/requirements/PRS-001.md)

## Requirements

1. The software shall detect atrial fibrillation by analysing R-R interval variability using a validated machine-learning algorithm.
2. The algorithm shall accept R-R intervals extracted from a 12-lead ECG signal as its primary input.
3. The algorithm shall output an AFib probability score in the range 0.0–1.0.
4. The algorithm shall be trained on a dataset of ≥ 10,000 annotated ECG recordings prior to validation.

## Verification Criteria

- Algorithm validation report demonstrates sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 90% on the hold-out dataset (see TP-002)
- Algorithm version is recorded in every persisted detection result (traceability to SRS-006)
- Boundary test: input of empty R-R array returns probability 0.0 without raising an exception
