# Software Requirement: Signal Quality Threshold

## Description

The software shall assess ECG signal quality and suppress detection results when quality falls below acceptable threshold.

## Rationale

Poor signal quality leads to unreliable detection. This requirement serves as a risk control for [RISK-SW-001](../risks/RISK-SW-001.md) (False Negative Detection Risk).

## Technical Specification

- Signal quality assessment: SNR-based algorithm
- Acceptable threshold: SNR ≥ 10 dB
- Poor quality handling:
  - Display "Signal Quality: Poor" indicator
  - Suppress detection result
  - Log quality issue for troubleshooting

## Acceptance Criteria

- Quality assessment within 500ms of signal receipt
- No detection results displayed when quality < threshold
- Quality status always visible to user
