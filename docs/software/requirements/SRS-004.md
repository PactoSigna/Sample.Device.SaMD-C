# Software Requirement: Signal Quality Threshold

**Derives from:** [PRS-001](../../product/requirements/PRS-001.md)

Risk control for [RISK-SW-001](../risks/RISK-SW-001.md) (False Negative Detection Risk).

## Requirements

1. The software shall assess ECG signal quality using an SNR-based algorithm for every incoming ECG segment before running AFib detection.
2. When the SNR falls below 10 dB, the software shall suppress the detection result and display a "Signal Quality: Poor" indicator in the UI.
3. The software shall log every signal-quality suppression event, including timestamp, measured SNR value, and the affected ECG segment reference.

## Verification Criteria

- Quality assessment completed within 500 ms of ECG segment receipt, measured at the 95th percentile (see TP-004 §2.1)
- No detection result displayed or persisted when SNR < 10 dB — verified by injecting synthetic low-SNR ECG data
- "Signal Quality: Poor" indicator visible in the UI within 1 second of the suppression trigger
- Quality suppression events present in the audit log with all required fields (cross-reference SRS-005)
