# Product Development Plan — CardioSense

## Scope

This Product Development Plan defines the design and development lifecycle for CardioSense, a Class IIa / Class II Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) for continuous ECG monitoring and automated atrial fibrillation detection.

## Intended Use

See [IU-001 — Intended Use](IU-001.md) for the canonical intended use definition.

## Design Inputs

### User Needs

- [UN-001 — Accurate Atrial Fibrillation Detection](user-needs/UN-001.md)
- [UN-002 — Clinician Review of Patient Data](user-needs/UN-002.md)

### Product Requirements

- [PRS-001 — Continuous ECG Monitoring](requirements/PRS-001.md)
- [PRS-002 — Atrial Fibrillation Detection Accuracy](requirements/PRS-002.md)
- [PRS-003 — Clear Detection Confidence Indicators](requirements/PRS-003.md)
- [PRS-004 — Secure Data Handling](requirements/PRS-004.md)

## Design and Development Phases

| Phase          | Activity                                        | Key Output                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. Planning    | Establish PDP, intended use, user needs         | This document, IU-001         |
| 2. Design Input | Capture product and software requirements      | PRS-\*, SRS-\*                |
| 3. Architecture | System architecture and detailed design        | HLD-001, SDD-001              |
| 4. Implementation | Software development per IEC 62304           | Source code, SOUP-001         |
| 5. Verification | Test protocols and execution                   | TP-\*, TR-\*                  |
| 6. Validation  | Usability evaluation (summative)                | SE-001                        |
| 7. Design Transfer | Release and deployment                      | Release package               |

## Discipline Plans

This PDP is the master plan. Discipline-specific plans provide detailed procedures:

- **Software Development:** [DEV-PLAN-001](../software/plans/DEV-PLAN-001.md) (IEC 62304 §5.1)
- **Risk Management:** [RMP-001](../risk/plans/RMP-001.md) (ISO 14971)
- **Usability Engineering:** [UEP-001](../usability/UEP-001.md) (IEC 62366)
- **Cybersecurity:** [CSPLAN-001](../cybersecurity/plans/CSPLAN-001.md) (IEC 81001-5-1)
- **Clinical Evaluation:** [CEP-001](../clinical/CEP-001.md) (MDR Art. 61)
- **Post-Market Surveillance:** [PMS-001](../post-market/PMS-001.md) (MDR Art. 83)

## Design Reviews

Design reviews are conducted at the transition between each phase. Review records include:

- Participants and their roles
- Items reviewed and criteria
- Actions and open items
- Approval signatures

## Verification and Validation Strategy

- **Verification:** Test protocols trace to software requirements via `verified_by` links. All SRS-\* documents must have at least one linked TP-\* protocol.
- **Validation:** Summative usability evaluation (SE-001) validates the device meets user needs in realistic conditions.
- **Traceability:** Full requirement traceability from UN → PRS → SRS → TP/TR maintained via markdown links.

## Responsible Personnel

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner    | Design input, user needs, product requirements                      |
| Software Lead    | Architecture, implementation, software verification                 |
| Quality Manager  | Design reviews, release approval, audit readiness                   |
| Regulatory Lead  | Classification, intended use, labeling, clinical evaluation         |
