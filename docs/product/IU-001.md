# Intended Use — CardioSense

## Product Information

- **Product name:** CardioSense
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Classification:** Class IIa (EU MDR 2017/745, Rule 11) / Class II (FDA De Novo)

## Intended Use

CardioSense is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) intended for continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. Detection results are presented to healthcare professionals for clinical review and decision-making.

## Intended Medical Indication

CardioSense is intended for screening and monitoring of atrial fibrillation in patients with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias. It is indicated for the detection of atrial fibrillation from single-lead ECG recordings obtained through compatible wearable ECG sensors.

CardioSense is intended as a clinical decision support tool and does not replace clinical judgment.

## Contraindications

- Not intended for use as the sole basis for clinical decisions
- Not intended for detection of arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation
- Not intended for use in patients under 18 years of age
- Not intended for use with implanted cardiac devices (pacemakers, ICDs)
- Not intended for acute cardiac emergency detection or response

## Patient Population

- Adults (18+) with suspected or diagnosed cardiac arrhythmias
- Patients suitable for ambulatory ECG monitoring
- No upper age limit; patients must be capable of wearing an ECG sensor

## User Profile

### Patient (Wearable ECG User)

- **Training:** Minimal — setup instructions provided with device
- **Technical proficiency:** Basic smartphone operation
- **Use frequency:** Daily (continuous wear)

### Healthcare Professional (Clinical Reviewer)

- **Training:** Medical degree + device-specific orientation
- **Technical proficiency:** Familiar with ECG interpretation and clinical decision support tools
- **Use frequency:** Daily during patient reviews

## Use Environment

### Patient Environment

- Home, daily life activities
- Compatible single-lead ECG wearable sensor paired via Bluetooth
- Smartphone with CardioSense mobile application

### Clinical Environment

- Clinic or hospital setting
- CardioSense clinician portal (web browser)
- Standard clinical workstation

## Operating Principle

CardioSense receives single-lead ECG signal data from a compatible wearable sensor paired via Bluetooth. The software applies a validated machine learning algorithm to analyze the ECG signal and detect episodes of atrial fibrillation. Detection results, including confidence scores, are presented to healthcare professionals through a clinician portal for review and clinical decision-making.

The software does not come in contact with tissue or bodily fluids. It processes digital ECG data and outputs detection results.

## Variants and Accessories

- No hardware variants — CardioSense is standalone software
- Compatible with any single-lead ECG wearable sensor that transmits data via Bluetooth
- Mobile application (iOS/Android) for patient-side data collection
- Web-based clinician portal for clinical review
