# Product Requirement: Clinical Performance Data Shall Support Claimed Sensitivity and Specificity

**Derives from:** [UN-009](../user-needs/UN-009.md)

## Description

Clinical performance data shall demonstrate that CardioSense achieves the sensitivity and specificity values claimed in the Instructions for Use when evaluated against cardiologist-adjudicated ground truth.

## Rationale

ISO 13485 §7.3.3 requires design inputs to include clinical requirements where applicable. For a SaMD making a clinical claim (≥95% sensitivity for AFib detection), the evidential basis for that claim must be established through a clinical evaluation, not through software testing alone. Analytical validation (software testing against a held-out dataset) is a component of the clinical evidence, but the totality of clinical evidence — including review of applicable literature and state-of-the-art assessment — must be documented in a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER).

This requirement is fulfilled by the CER (a clinical design output), not by software. The CER undergoes design review as its verification method per ISO 13485 §7.3.5.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CER documents all clinical data sources (internal studies, literature, post-market data)
- CER demonstrates performance claims are supported by evidence at the intended use population level
- Performance claims in the IFU are consistent with conclusions in the CER
- CER reviewed by a qualified clinical evaluator and approved by the regulatory/quality function

**Implements:** [CER-001](../../clinical/CER-001.md)
