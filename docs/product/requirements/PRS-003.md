# Product Requirement: Clear Detection Confidence Indicators

**Derives from:** [UN-002](../user-needs/UN-002.md), [TA-001](../../usability/task-analyses/TA-001.md)

## Description

The system shall display detection confidence using clear visual indicators (colour coding and numerical score) that clinicians can interpret at a glance.

## Rationale

Clinicians must quickly understand the reliability of each detection result. Ambiguous presentation could lead to misinterpretation and incorrect treatment decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Confidence displayed as percentage (0–100%)
- Colour coding: Green (≥ 90%), Yellow (70–89%), Red (< 70%)
- Confidence definition documented in user manual
