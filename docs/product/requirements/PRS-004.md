# Product Requirement: 21 CFR Part 11 Audit Trail

> **Traceability note:** This is a standalone regulatory requirement derived directly from 21 CFR Part 11 §11.10(e), not from a user need. No `derives_from` link is present; the platform will surface a `prs_no_upstream` warning, which is the correct behaviour for regulatory-source requirements that have no upstream user need.

## Description

The system shall maintain a complete audit trail of all data creation, modification, and access events per 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.

## Rationale

FDA regulations require medical device software to maintain audit trails for electronic records. Non-compliance exposes the organisation to regulatory action and invalidates the electronic signature framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All data changes logged with timestamp, user identity, and action type
- Audit records immutable — cannot be deleted or modified after creation
- Audit log accessible to authorised users with appropriate role permissions
- Records retained for the duration required by the applicable data retention policy
