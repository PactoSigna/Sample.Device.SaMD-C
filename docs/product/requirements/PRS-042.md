# Product Requirement: IFU Shall Describe Contraindications for Paediatric Patients

**Derives from:** [UN-008](../user-needs/UN-008.md)

## Description

The Instructions for Use (IFU) shall explicitly state that CardioSense is not indicated for use in patients under 18 years of age, and shall describe the clinical rationale for this contraindication.

## Rationale

CardioSense is validated only on adult ECG morphology. The device has not been clinically evaluated in paediatric populations, where ECG characteristics (heart rate variability, waveform amplitude, QRS duration) differ significantly from adults. The absence of this contraindication in labeling would constitute a labeling deficiency under 21 CFR §801.109 and MDR Annex I §23.

This requirement is fulfilled by a labeling design output (the IFU), not by software. The IFU undergoes design review as its verification method per ISO 13485 §7.3.5.

## Acceptance Criteria

- IFU contains a Contraindications section
- Contraindications section explicitly names patients under 18 years of age as a contraindicated population
- Clinical rationale for the paediatric contraindication is provided (validation scope basis)
- Content reviewed and approved by qualified regulatory reviewer

**Implements:** [LBL-001](../../labeling/LBL-001.md)
