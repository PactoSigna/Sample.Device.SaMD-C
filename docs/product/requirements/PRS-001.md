# Product Requirement: AFib Detection Sensitivity

**Derives from:** [UN-001](../user-needs/UN-001.md)

## Description

The system shall detect atrial fibrillation episodes with a sensitivity of at least 95% when compared to cardiologist adjudication.

## Rationale

High sensitivity is critical for a screening device to minimise false negatives. A missed AFib episode could result in delayed treatment and increased stroke risk. The 95% threshold aligns with FDA guidance for cardiac rhythm detection devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sensitivity ≥ 95% on validation dataset (n ≥ 500 AFib episodes)
- Validation dataset includes diverse patient demographics
- 95% confidence interval reported alongside point estimate
