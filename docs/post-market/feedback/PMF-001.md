|--------|-------|----------------|
| Customer support portal | 7 | General feedback (non-complaint) |
| Clinical site reports | 3 | Complaint — usability |
| Field service reports | 1 | Complaint — performance |
| Literature monitoring | 1 | General feedback |

Complaints were triaged per SOP-PMS-001 §4.1. No serious incidents or near-misses were identified.

## Feedback Details

### Complaint C-2026-001: AF Detection Alert Delay

- **Date:** 2026-01-15
- **Source:** Clinical site (St. Mary's Hospital)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Clinician reported a 45-second delay between AF detection and alert display on the clinician portal. Expected latency is <10 seconds per SRS-004.
- **Root Cause:** Network timeout retry logic in the portal was using exponential backoff with a maximum delay that exceeded the SRS requirement threshold.
- **Disposition:** CAPA initiated (see Actions Taken).

### Complaint C-2026-002: Wearable Pairing Failure

- **Date:** 2026-02-03
- **Source:** Customer support
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Patient reported intermittent Bluetooth pairing failures with Samsung Galaxy S24. Resolved by clearing Bluetooth cache and re-pairing.
- **Root Cause:** Known Android 15 Bluetooth stack issue affecting first-time pairing with BLE 5.3 devices.
- **Disposition:** Added to known issues list. Monitoring for trend.

### Complaint C-2026-003: ECG Waveform Rendering

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Source:** Clinical site (Valley Medical Center)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** ECG waveform display showed artifacts when browser zoom was set above 150%. Did not affect algorithm performance or detection accuracy.
- **Root Cause:** Canvas rendering scaling issue in the waveform visualization component.
- **Disposition:** Bug fix scheduled for v2.2 release.

## Trend Analysis

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Trend |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Total feedback items | 8 | 12 | +50% (attributable to expanded user base) |
| Complaints | 1 | 3 | +200% (within expected range for 3x user growth) |
| Complaint rate (per 100 users) | 0.5 | 0.5 | Stable |
| Vigilance-reportable events | 0 | 0 | Stable |

No statistically significant adverse trends identified when normalized for user base growth.

## Risk Assessment

- **C-2026-001 (Alert Delay):** Potential impact on timely clinical intervention. Risk-benefit remains acceptable — alert was delivered within 60 seconds and AF is not an immediately life-threatening arrhythmia in the monitored population. Risk matrix updated: residual risk unchanged (probability: remote, severity: minor).
- **C-2026-002 (Pairing):** No patient safety impact. Usability inconvenience only.
- **C-2026-003 (Waveform):** No impact on diagnostic accuracy. Cosmetic rendering issue at non-standard zoom levels.

No new hazards identified. No changes to the overall risk-benefit profile per RMP-001.

## Actions Taken

| Action | Reference | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Alert latency fix — reduce max retry timeout | CAPA-2026-003 | Closed — fix verified in v2.1.1 |
| Add Samsung Galaxy S24 to compatibility matrix | Backlog item #847 | Completed |
| Canvas waveform scaling fix | Bug #912 | Scheduled for v2.2 |
| Update known issues documentation | LBL-001 rev 3 | Completed |

## Conclusion

Q1 2026 post-market feedback indicates stable product performance. Complaint rate per user remains constant despite user base growth. No vigilance-reportable events. One CAPA was raised and resolved within the quarter. Recommend continuing current surveillance cadence with no changes to the PMS plan (PMS-001).
