# Post-Market Surveillance Plan — CardioSense

## Scope

This plan defines the post-market surveillance activities for CardioSense per MDR Article 84 and FDA 21 CFR 803. It covers complaint handling, vigilance reporting, trend analysis, and post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF).

## Data Sources

| Source | Frequency | Responsible |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Customer complaints | Continuous | Quality Manager |
| Vigilance reports | As required | Regulatory Affairs |
| Literature monitoring | Quarterly | Clinical Affairs |
| Algorithm performance metrics | Monthly | Software Engineering |
| CVE/security advisories | Weekly | Cybersecurity (per CSPLAN-001) |

## Complaint Handling

1. **Intake**: All complaints logged within 24 hours of receipt
2. **Classification**: Safety-related vs. non-safety-related
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis for all safety complaints within 10 business days
4. **CAPA**: Corrective/preventive action initiated if systemic issue identified
5. **Closure**: Resolution documented and communicated to complainant

## Vigilance Reporting

### Serious Incident Criteria
- Death or serious deterioration in health
- Device malfunction that could lead to death or serious injury if recurred
- For CardioSense: undetected AF episode leading to stroke or TIA

### Reporting Timelines
| Event Type | EU (MDR Art. 87) | US (FDA 21 CFR 803) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Death | 10 days | 30 days |
| Serious injury | 15 days | 30 days |
| Malfunction (potential harm) | 15 days | 30 days |
| Trend report | As identified | Annual |

## PMCF Study

A post-market clinical follow-up study will monitor real-world detection performance:

- **Objective**: Confirm sensitivity >= 95% and specificity >= 90% in clinical practice
- **Population**: 500 patients across 5 clinical sites
- **Duration**: 24 months from first market release
- **Endpoints**: Sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate, time-to-detection
- **Interim analysis**: At 6 and 12 months

## Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)

A PSUR will be produced annually (Class IIa device) per MDR Article 86, summarizing:
- Complaint and vigilance data
- PMCF study interim results
- Benefit-risk reassessment
- Any required labeling or design changes
